## How it works

Given some input current, the neuron's membrane potential will change and 
if a threshold is met, the trigger output goes high.

## How to test

Run the cocotb test and in gtkwave or something else, view the output bits and 
look for a trigger toggle given your input

## External hardware

None, other than maybe some way of inputting current and reading output (power supply and oscilloscope)
